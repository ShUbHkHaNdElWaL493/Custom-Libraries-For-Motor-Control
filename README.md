# Custom-Libraries-For-Motor-Control

This repository contains some custom libraries that can be useful for motor control and implementing PID control. They are based on the different pins used by different motor drivers along with the presence or absence of encoders. These libraries use the Arduino framework for operation. PlatformIO or ArduinoIDE are recommended to be used for these libraries.
// Note: 
The PID library can not be used without the presence of encoders. For using PID without encoders, the algorithm mentioned in this link can be used: https://github.com/ShUbHkHaNdElWaL493/PID-Algorithm.
